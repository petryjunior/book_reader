# StoryGlass Reader

Qt desktop reader that synchronizes author-supplied imagery with ongoing narrative passages.

## Highlights
- Book loader + metadata-driven image catalog.
- Context matcher that listens for navigation events and surfaces relevant art.
- Persistent layout/configuration state.
- Qt UI with text viewer, image pane, and control toolbar.

## Resources
Place your art files inside `resources/images/` and reference them from a catalog like `resources/sample_catalog.yaml`.
The sample catalog points to placeholders; replace the paths with your own JPEG/PNG assets before use.
