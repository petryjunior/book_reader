Chapter 1 — Dawn Ride
The wind screamed past the open carriage as Mara leaned forward. Frost spiders glimmered in the light of the rising sun, weaving fragile webs between iron rails.
Steam curled from the engine, the metal hiss echoing the rhythm of her heart. Every mile forward thinned the fog, leaving only the whisper of powder-dry snow in the air.
She traced her fingers over the leather strap, watching minute sparks ignite where sunlight hit the rail; the light was colder than the sky made it feel.

Chapter 2 — Market Whispers
Lanterns bobbed above the stalls while merchants shouted about spice-laden tales. Mara rested by the fountain, the tapestry of smells hinting at faraway deserts.
Baskets of cardamom and star anise spilled into the walkways, their seeds sliding across the cobblestones with a dry rattle. A boy offered her candied ginger, and the sharp sweetness pushed against the lingering winter breath.
Conversations braided together in a chorus—laughter, curated warnings, the clink of copper scales. The bazaar felt like a living throat, every breath carrying a new rumor in its wake.

Chapter 3 — Nightfall Tread
Shadows melted into one another on the cobbles; the distant howls from the ridge reminded Mara of the kinship between road and sky.
The moon rode high and thin, and a hush fell over the ridge, broken only by a distant coil of wolves answering one another. She could feel the rocks letting out cold breaths of their own.
A stray lantern from a traveler bobbed ahead, a warm coin in a sea of blue. Mara found comfort in that amber flash, as if it insisted the road still remembered the way home.
